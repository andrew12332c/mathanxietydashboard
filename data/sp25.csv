Response ID,Response Status,Timestamp (mm/dd/yyyy),Duplicate,Time Taken to Complete (Seconds),External Reference,Country Code,Region,Block Order,Question Order,You are invited to participate in the Spring 2025 Course Survey and Study. This survey is intended to understand relationships between college students' views and attitudes about learning society and learning. You will be asked to respond to questions about the following topics:Classroom ExperienceCultural AttitudesAttitudes Toward LearningPersonal CharacteristicsBasic Demographic InformationYou will also be presented with several cognitive tasks (e.g. memory reasoning).The survey will take no more than 30 minutes to complete. You may experience some mild to moderate embarrassment when answering some questions as they may be somewhat personal in nature. Participation is voluntary and your are free to withdraw from the study at any time. If you do not want to participate in this survey please email fernanr1@uci.edu to complete an alternative assignment which will involve responding to a reading which should take 30 minutes to complete. This study is exempt from IRB review (UCI IRB Exempt # 13991) meaning that it does not pose any psychological or personal harm to you. As part of this study you will also complete a survey in Week 7 at which point you will be debriefed about the nature of the study and the research questions the study team is interested in answering. The survey results will be de-identified meaning that the lead researcher (Fernando Rodriguez) removes names email address and anything else that can be traced back to you prior to distributing the data.Should you have any concerns about the survey please email fernanr1@uci.edu.By completing the survey your responses may lead to important insights about college student learning and development.BestDr. Fernando Rodriguez Assistant Professor of TeachingSchool of Education UC Irvine,Page Timer,You will now answer some questions about the image. Click 'Next' to begin. ,The image you saw was taken on a hot sunny day during Spring quarter at the vendor fair on Ring Road. Typically students enjoy browsing around the vendor fair during their breaks between their afternoon classes. The students in the photo were wearing an array of colorful backpacks. One group of students was gathered looking at posters while the second group was grabbing drinks. A student in the back was looking through a crate full of superhero posters. Near the drinks one of the students was giving water to his service animal. Because of the Spring heat students enjoy buying cool drinks at the vendor fair.,The image you saw was taken during the Spring quarter vendor fair on Ring Road. The vendor fair is coordinated by the Associated Students of UCI and is a week-long fair that takes place around the middle of each quarter except the summer. Typically vendors from the Irvine and Orange County areas come to sell their items. Students enjoy browsing through the various booths throughout the week as there is a large variety in items sold. The image you saw was specifically of a group of students gathered at a booth looking at posters.,Check all the items that were in the image.,,,,,,,,,,Was there a dog in the image?,What color was the dog's fur?,How confident are you that you provided accurate answers to the previous questions?,How confident are you in your ability to remember things you see in general?,I have trouble organizing my activities,I change tasks without finishing them,I’m not sure what to do next,It takes me a long time to get going,I often feel like I have few useful hours in the day,I plan my daily activities,I engage in structured activities,I follow a daily routine,My activities follow a consistent pattern,I persist until I complete a task,I give up easily,I have difficulty finishing what I start,Most things feel like they don’t matter,Life feels aimless or without purpose,I feel bored with my daily activities,Time often feels like it has little value,I believe most things have a purpose,I often daydream about the future,I think about my future,I feel I’ve missed out on opportunities,"Please select Sometimes"" for this item""",🔴? Science News TodayHaving ‘Frenemies’ Improves Children’s Social DevelopmentMeagan Phillips Science WriterAugust 5th 2024My neighbor Amy a middle school student doesn’t like her classmate. One afternoon Amy told me “Sandra and I have the same friends but she has a bad temper. She even pushed me once in front of everyone. We were with our friends acting silly but got angry when we started teasing her. She shoved me and I fell pretty bad. After that I was like I’m done with you.”When I asked Sandra she said “Amy is nice but she also has a bad side. She likes finding ways to put people down. One day she wouldn’t stop teasing me in front our friends so I thought enough is enough. I didn’t push her hard but she pretended to fall. I can’t stand how fake she can be.”I see both girls playing in our neighborhood frequently and what is interesting about Amy and Sandra is that despite their grudge both are well adjusted. They have close friends and get along with others.While bullying is a problem in schools new research finds that having strained friendships or what’s known as ‘frenemies’ can actually benefit children’s social development.In a recent study researchers asked 8 middle school students to privately report whether they had a friend who they actually disliked. The researchers then identified the children who disliked each other. The children with no mutual dislikes served as the comparison group.The study found that having frenemies improved children’s social development.For both girls and boys children who disliked each other scored 2 percentage points higher on a social skills assessment than children in the comparison group.While the idea is very uncomfortable to many parents it really is important to let children experience the not-so-good parts of forming friendships.After playing for a bit Sandra ran up to me and said “Amy and I still talk I guess. It’s hard to stay mad at her. She’s my friend after all.,🔴? Science News TodayHaving ‘Frenemies’ Improves Children’s Social DevelopmentMeagan Phillips Science WriterAugust 5th 2024Social interactions among middle school students are often complex. At this age children are developing stronger relationships with peers while also learning how to navigate disagreements competition and shifting social dynamics. School environments provide opportunities not just for academic learning but also for important emotional and interpersonal development.During early adolescence many students begin to form close-knit friend groups while also encountering conflict or rivalry. These experiences can range from minor disagreements to more persistent tension. Researchers are increasingly interested in how these experiences affect children’s emotional growth including their ability to manage social challenges and maintain relationships over time.While bullying is a problem in schools new research finds that having strained friendships or what’s known as ‘frenemies’ can actually benefit children’s social development.In a recent study researchers asked 8 middle school students to privately report whether they had a friend who they actually disliked.
